QuoteQuest: A Web Scraping and Data Analysis Project
This project extracts famous quotes from a website, stores them, and performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights. It demonstrates a complete data pipeline from data acquisition to analysis.

 Description
The goal of this project is to build a simple web scraper to collect quotes, authors, and tags, and then analyze the collected data. This involves two main phases:

Web Scraping: A Python script (WebScrape.ipynb) fetches data from a quotes website and saves it into a structured CSV file (quotes.csv).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): A separate Jupyter Notebook (EDA.ipynb) is used to load the scraped data, clean it, and create visualizations to understand patterns, such as the most prolific authors or the most common quote tags.

 Features
Web Scraper: Efficiently extracts quote text, author names, and associated tags.

Data Storage: Saves the scraped data in a clean, easy-to-use CSV format.

Data Analysis: Analyzes and visualizes key aspects of the quotes data.


Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language.

Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and analysis.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Beautiful Soup & Requests: For web scraping.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
