# QuoteQuest 

__A Web Scraping and Data Analysis Project__
__This project extracts famous quotes from a website, stores them, and performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights. It demonstrates a complete data pipeline from data acquisition to analysis.__

__Description__

__The goal of this project is to build a simple web scraper to collect quotes, authors, and tags, and then analyze the collected data. This involves two main phases:__

> Web Scraping: A Python script (WebScrape.ipynb) fetches data from a quotes website and saves it into a structured CSV file (quotes.csv).

> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): A separate Jupyter Notebook (EDA.ipynb) is used to load the scraped data, clean it, and create visualizations to understand patterns, such as the most prolific authors or the most common quote tags.

__Technologies Used:__

>Python: The core programming language.

>Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and analysis.

>Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

>Beautiful Soup & Requests: For web scraping.

>Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
